# Starting out with ESLint
## Lets Learn an ESLint Rule

The Semi rule, no matter how it is set (always, or never) simply enforces a consistent use of semicolons.
It is important to be consistent so that you can trouble shoot a bug easier, and so that your code can be consistent with the teams code.
While Javascript will automatically add semicolons, its best not to simply rely on the program correctly interperating what you want.
Consistency is the mark of a professional, and it is easier (and better) to stick to one system, than it is to add semicolons randomly.
